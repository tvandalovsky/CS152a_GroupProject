# CS152a_GroupProject
this is the group project from group 5 
Our project is an app that matches employers and employees. A user signs up as either and employer or an employee along with information about themselves and their company or educational background. Employers specify what position they are looking to hire and employees specify their discpiline. If an employee's skill 
matches and the employee's desired position the employee and the employeer will match. An employee and employers can view their matches' email. Once they click on the email, they will be redirect to an blank email adressed to their match. Users can also view all  employees and emploers along with their information.
